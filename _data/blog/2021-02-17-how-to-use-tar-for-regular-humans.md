Tar is a powerful command-line tool. I was setting up some Jenkins job and wanted to create an artifact to use with another pipeline. I first needed to zip up a directory and then unzip the said tar file. Looking at tar command and needed flags, they look a bit intimidating; such as `-xvf`. what are those flags?  I'm a big fan of long-from flags so here is how you tar a directory and how you unzip it. 

zip it: 

```
tar --gzip --create --file name.tar.gz --directory ./path/to/directory .
```

Short form: 
```
tar -zcf name.tar.gz -C ./path/to/directory .
```

Now that you have a tar file, you can untar it by: 
```
tar --extract --file name.tar.gz --directory ./path/to/directory
```

Short form: 
```
tar -xf name.tar.gz -C ./path/to/directory
```

You need to make sure the directory exists when you are extracting it. 

ðŸ¤” Here is a little secret. use man to understand command flags. Try `man tar` and see the explanation for each flag.
