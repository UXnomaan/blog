#### Who am I?

I'm Nomaan. I moved to the US in 2008, great ~~recession~~ decision on my part! I started studying Civil Engineering before immigrating but realized my opportunities might be extremely limited if I want to finish my Civil Engineering degree. I decided to enroll to a community college to learn English as I didn't know much before moving. Soon after, I started studying Information Technology in Rochester Institute of Technology; this was a great decision as I was getting exposed to a lot tech fields all at once and I could decide which one I want to pursuit as a career. As I was progressing through my undergrad, I started falling in love with web development, thanks to great teaching style of [Sean](https://www.rit.edu/directory/spbics-sean-boyle) also known as [darkbolt](https://www.darkbolt.com/about.html).

I developed a great interest for photography. Here's some of my work: https://www.flickr.com/photos/nomaan/
